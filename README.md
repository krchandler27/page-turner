# Project Description
Page Turner is a web application that allows users to join a book club. Members can add books to the site, add comments to the books, discuss books and organize virtual meetings. Page Turner also uses an internal custom-made database to get and post data about books and allow users to search based on genre, author, and other factors. Page Turner also implements user authentication to allow users to track their reading progress, update or delete books and comments that they themselves have added.

This application uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the template engine to create a great looking site along with MySQL and Sequelize ORM for the database.
